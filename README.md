## Description of the project

This repo contains a fork of [SplitMe](https://github.com/hidroh/splitme/), a project created by [Ha Duy Trung](https://github.com/hidroh) to add a quick settings tile to toggle the split screen functionality in devices with Android 9 (Pie) and above, where this functionality may be hidden.

The fork was created to try to bring a little more life into the original project, by adding some additional features and experimenting a bit.
